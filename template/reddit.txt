Complete Guide To Flutter Project(#100FlutterAppChallenge)

Hey, Everyone!



I'm happy to share the update the in Project(Complete Guides to Flutter). Today I had created my 21's App, In Indian Culture 21 is a lucky no, so thought to share it with my Reddit Community after a long time. I know, I was not consistent(because of my SDE Internship) in this #100DaysFlutterChallenge, but I am happy that in the last 1 week I was able to create 10 Mini Apps related to Flutter where I had learnt about following:



Different widgets like Bottom Navigation bar, Dynamic Search bar.

Animations during the widget.

State Management Techniques like Provider, Redux and Mobx etc.

Being an Open Source Developer and Enthusiast, I had met with lots of developers and their project which had helped a hundred-thousands of people all around the world. I also want the Complete Guide to Flutter will be able to create a resource full of knowledge so that any newbie can learn from that repo.

10 Apps which I had created in this 1-2 weeks are as follows:



1.Flutter_PDF_Viewer

2.Flutter_Web_Firebase_Authentication

3.Flutter_Mortage_Payment_App_1_Beta

4. Firebase Quotes App

5.Bloc Pattern Weather App(#WIP)

6.Flutter Web Sign In Anonymously App:

7. Flutter News API.org Project 

8. Flutter Movie App using JSON

and 2 more project includes UI design related to Food Application.

From today onwards, I will make sure that I will create 1 App every day, so stay tuned.
