#### 012 - Flutter_Web_Firebase_Authentication:

After so much hectic, I am succesfully able to integerate the Firebase Auth in Flutter Web. This is still in beta phase.

The best part is that all the functionalities are working properly, this is just the prototype version of the Flutter Web Firebase Authentication. More to be updated in the future.

The article which I had referred can be found on this [link]().

Everything is working quite fine and intutive.
