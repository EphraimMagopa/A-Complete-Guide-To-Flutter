#### 017 - Flutter NewsAPI.org:

Flutter NewsAPI is a project which is created to fetch the data from the NewsAPI.org and listing it using the Cached Network Image, HTTP and WebView Flutter plugins, so that we will be able to create a News Application in a limited amount of time.

    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      cached_network_image: ^2.2.0+1
      http: ^0.12.1
      webview_flutter: ^0.3.22+1
      
Everything is working quite fine and intutive.
